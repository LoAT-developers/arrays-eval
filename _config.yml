  We propose a novel acceleration technique for single-path
  loops operating on arrays. The goal of acceleration is to characterize
  the transitive closure of loops in a logic which is suitable for automated
  reasoning. Compared to earlier approaches, our first contribution is the
  novel notion of inductive lvalues, which allows us to handle array-loops
  where previous techniques fail, and to unify acceleration for arrays and
  scalar variables by regarding scalars as arrays of dimension 0. Moreover,
  we propose the use of λs instead of quantifiers in the resulting formulas to
  facilitate automated reasoning. Then the corresponding SMT problems
  can be solved with a refinement loop in the spirit of lemmas on demand.
